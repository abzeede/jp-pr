# Proof of Pension and Health Insurance Payment

## Proof of Pension Payment
** Please make sure that this document is issued within 3 months before the application date.**

This is the most troublesome document for me. Based on the description on the website, you can do this in three ways.

### Use Pension Coverage Regular Notice 
This is the postcard sent to you on your 35th, 45th, 59th year of birth. It is not the postcard you receive from the nenkin office yearly. This looks like the worst choice among three.


### Print out the pension payment of each months from Nenkin-net
This is actually the easiest option, but you need the hard version of MyNumber card. You can get into the essential screen by following the below steps.

1. Log into [myna-portal](https://myna.go.jp/) and log in.
2. After logging in, click on the below image.

3. After getting to Nenkin-net, click on the トップページ.

### Use the certificate issued by the Nenkin office
This is also the option you should avoid, but is still preferable that the first option. To get this, you need to visit the Nenkin office and ask for the below documents.
