# Letter of Intent
This is an essay to state the reason why you need the permanent residence. There is no hard requirements on this, after asking friends who applied before, seem like the proper length is about 1 - 2 A4.

I suggest sending only the Japanese translated version. I wrote mine in English before translating it to Japanese by my own + google translate, then asked a Japanese friend to proof-read. 

In my case, I first introduced my name, then described my education and working experience in my home country in the first three paragraphs. Next, I wrote about how I came to Japan, followed by my working experience. Then I mentioned about my thought on software development in Japan that has a better career growth. Finally stated that growing on a career and to live in Japan happily are the reason of my application.
